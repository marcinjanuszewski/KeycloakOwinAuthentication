Dylan Plecki, the developer of main project, has ran out of time to develop and maintenance this project. I decided to fork this project and continue his great work.

# Keycloak OWIN Authentication [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/xf1kvor22ya99h6w?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/DylanPlecki/keycloakowinauthentication)
###### Owin.Security.Keycloak - OWIN Authentication Middleware for C# Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From [Keycloak's Website](http://keycloak.jboss.org/):
> Keycloak is an integrated SSO and IDM for browser apps and RESTful web services, built on top of OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and SAML 2.0 specifications.
Keycloak has tight integration with a variety of platforms and has an HTTP security proxy service where we don't have tight integration.

This project is an unofficial Keycloak connector for C#. It is designed as an OWIN authentication middleware component, and can import user data,
including roles and authorization information, into the OWIN pipeline for use in ASP.NET, WPF, and any other C# application.
